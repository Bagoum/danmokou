.z `You did it again!`
sre junko worry
.z `What? No, no, this time I did not turn it into a circle.`
srce special
.z `You were firing danmaku from the middle of nowhere. That is sloppy and visually unclear style. All danmaku should be fired from one's own position or from a subsummon.`
.z `I simply moved your danmaku back to a single origin. I did not change the structure.`
slc
.z `Yeah, and as a result there were two BoWaPs...`
sre yukari worry
.z `From now on, if you want to screw with my BoWaP, only do the yellow ones, alright?`
sre junko _
.z `If you insist.`
srce special
.z `Ah, also, why not show us your crows? I would very much like to purify their beautiful lasers. I myself cannot, regrettably, create textures that vibrant.`
sre yukari worry
.z `...Fine.`
slc
.z `What about you? I haven't seen you fire a single bullet yet. Are you even taking this seriously?`
sr junko
.z `Naive words, little miko.`
.z `Anyone can fire their own danmaku. Such is a task worthy of bugs and fairies.`
srce normal
.z `But to take another's danmaku and make it one's own, to redefine it, to reinterpret it... this is a task only achievable with a great mind and an untiring soul.`
.z `My strength lies not in creating pure danmaku. It lies in purifying all phenomena under the skies.`
srce special
.z `How regrettable it is that I was not able to show to you this power when first we met. Had you not driven off my little burger-loving friend, we would have been together able to put on display some true horrors.`
sre yukari angry
.z `Silence, both of you. I'm starting the next card.`
