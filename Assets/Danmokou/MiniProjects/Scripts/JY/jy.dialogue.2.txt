.z `Hey, Junko.`
sr junko
.z `Is there something wrong, old crow?`
sre yukari surprise
.z `Of course there is! Why won't you let me do my Border of Wave and Particle?`
sre junko worry
.z `Your... what?`
sre yukari angry
.z `My Border of Wave and Particle! I keep trying to fire one, and you keep turning it into a circle!`
sre junko special
.z `I am certain that, at the least just now, I was using spheres and not circles.`
sre yukari cry
.z `That's not the point!`
sre junko worry
.z `It seems that I do not understand your actions here, old crow. Are you telling me that just now, when you were firing danmaku in childishly spiral-shaped patterns, that you were in fact using a complex spellcard technique?`
sre junko special
.z `It appeared to me that you were just dropping fodder randomly for me to purify.`

.z `Wait, Yukari, you're still using BoWaP? It's 2020, Mima is back, and you're still using BoWaP?`
sr yukari
.z `I...`
sre junko _
.z `Well, I suppose the Skyfeller attracts all kinds of followers. I may not understand your reasons, but I shall try to avoid entirely purifying your, uh, Barter of Wafer and Barnacle.`
.z `My circles would be somewhat impure as a result, but I suppose it bears no real consequence for this sparring match.`
sre junko special
.z `Or, if you run two of them at a time, I can purify one and leave the other. Would you like to take a break for a short strategy meeting?`
sre yukari angry
.z `No. We'll do it live.`
