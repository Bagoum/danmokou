This project has several submodules under the Assets folder (BRuH, LuA, SiMP, and SZYU). If you are viewing this license from source code, you can find licenses for each submodule within its folder. If you are viewing this license alongside a binary executable, you should find licenses for any included submodules distributed alongside this file. Note that submodules may have different licensing terms-- you can reference the LICENSE file for each submodule for details.

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide

with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
